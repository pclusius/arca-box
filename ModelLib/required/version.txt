1.3.1
Updates:
- GUI: option to accomodate the gui for dark mode. Note, the gui still uses system theme, but the colours
and logos in the GUI are tuned for fdark background.
- GUI: gui_config.ini file for global options

1.3.0
Updates:
- aerosol emissions can be added as time-dependent modes (maximum number of modes is 99 but this will be very slow).
  Each mode consists of GMD [m], ln(sigma) [-] and emissions [s⁻¹]. Same input methods apply as for other inputs.
- As a first step to particle phase chemistry, version 1.3 will be used to deliver parametric aging of particles.

Fixes:
- Fixed a problem when condensation was not used but vapour file still needed to be properly defined.
- GUI: Added troubleshooting options for high dpi scaling
- Other minor fixes in GUI
- Fixed further bugs in elemental composition of PRAM HOMs compounds

1.2.2
Updates:
- added MTChamberEms2 chemistry which was used in the ARCA GMD paper.
- time units in the ENV and MCM files as well as loss rate files are explicitly defined in the gui
- Surface tension and Wall accommodation coefficient can optionally be set in the Vapour file
- chemical reaction rate constants can be modified dynamically (experimental feature)
Fixes:
- increased the buffer size of input to accommodate huge input files.
- minor bug fixes in the GUI

1.2.1
Fixes:
- Fixed bug in GetVapourPressures.py which saved the wrong elemental composition of filtered sets

1.2.0

What's new:
- 5 ACDC systems that are dynamically used so that their monomer names and system size can be changed without hard
  coding, needs recompiling though
- ACDC systems have proper recording of the inut data files and system names
- Added new section to the GUI->"Cluster formation"-tab, where ACDC components can be linked with model components
- Updated ACDC plugin
- Hyde3 chemistry scheme replaced Hyde2. Inorganic precursors are fixed (their concentration time derivatives are 0).
  This steady state approach is already used in some OVOCs in the scheme. The user is advised to check the compounds in
  listed unde DEFFIX in file second.def and use the appropriate approach for their work.
- Drag and drop INITFILE loading
- Losses calculated with DVODE
- loss parametrization clarified
- Updated spectral data
- It is possible to send in direct actinic flux data
- (multi)modal distribution shows mass and total area
- ARCA paper submission version

Fixes:
- Fixed SMEAR II short wave radiation spectrum
- Windows installer now prefers pyqtgraph 0.12.0
- Minor bug fixes in GUI and Fortran model


1.1.2
Hotfix:
- fixed error in calculation of Koehler factor for particles of size 1 nm (in aerosol_dynamics.f90)


1.1.1
Fixes:
- Fixed empty array problem in second_reactivity.90 and add_reactivity.py (producing error with some fortran compilers).
- Fixed makefile (version control gave problems on some Win systems)


1.1.0

ARCA is now licenced under GNU GPL


1.0.6

Fixes:
- Kelvin term was approximated using Taylor series. This is a bad approximation with very small particles.
  Now Kelvin term is calculated using exponential form. To use the old Kelvin term (used by many other models and the
  ACP scheme), set custom option (in NML_CUSTOM or in the GUI Run ARCA -> Custom model options) Kelvin_taylor = .true.

(Further additions in current version, will be put to next release)
  What's new:
  Fixes:


1.0.5

What's new:
- makefile supplemented with Puhti configurations
- Output directories are now created automatically

Fixes:
- makefile improved; compiling chemistry module for the first time should not lead to error
- On mac, the setup.py creates run_arca.command instead of run_arca.sh; is also be double-clickable
- gui: replaced some deprecated Pyqtgraph methods giving errors on pyqtgraph 0.12
- gui: fixed duplicating legend in mass plot


1.0.4

What's new:
- added GPL licence to KPP and ACDC directories.
- added coag_sink to Particles.nc
- added CS_calc to General.nc

Fixes:
- Added new Hyde chemistry to accommodate reactivity calculations
- fixed color issues in mass plotting
- fix for how losses file was interpolated


1.0.3

What's new:
- Create second_reactivity.f90
Fixes:
- minor fixes in the mass plotting
