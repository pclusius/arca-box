1.1.1
Fixes:
- Fixed empty array problem in second_reactivity.90 and add_reactivity.py (producing error with some fortran compilers).
- Fixed makefile (version control gave problems on some Win systems)


1.1.0

ARCA is now licenced under GNU GPL


1.0.6

Fixes:
- Kelvin term was approximated using Taylor series. This is a bad approximation with very small particles.
  Now Kelvin term is calculated using exponential form. To use the old Kelvin term (used by many other models and the
  ACP scheme), set custom option (in NML_CUSTOM or in the GUI Run ARCA -> Custom model options) Kelvin_taylor = .true.

(Further additions in current version, will be put to next release)
