1.0.6

Fixes:
- Kelvin term was approximated using Taylor series. This was a bad approximation with very small particles.
  Now Kelvin term is calculated using exponential for. To use old Kelvin term, set custom option (in NML_CUSTOM or
  in the GUI Run ARCA -> Custom model options) Kelvin_taylor = .true.
