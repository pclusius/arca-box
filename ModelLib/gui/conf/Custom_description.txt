TYPE,UNIT,NAME,DESCRIPTION
----,----,----,-----------
LGCL,,USE_RAOULT,"T/F when T, use Raoult's law, the solute effect to the saturation concentration. Should generally always be T."
REAL,min,DMPS_TRES_MIN,10 Time resolution for the background particles file.
REAL,sec,START_TIME_S,"0 If > 0, the simulation clock will be set to this time when the integration loop starts.  By default the simulation clock starts at oo:oo (midnight). A caveat is that if background aerosols are initialized for example for 1 hour, and start_time_s>3600, there will be no initialization for particles. If the initialization is set to 2 hours, particles are constrained one hour. The model assumes that the input files still start at time zero (specifically, the first time stamp is subtracted from the time vector). Therefore, if the input data must contain some values at midnight, it is sufficient to have a row of zeros (one in each column) in the beginning of the input file (after the header)."
REAL,,DMPS_MULTI,1e6 The conversion factor to convert the number concentration values in the background particle file from particles/cmü to particles/mü.
CHRC,,INITIALIZE_WITH,Path to a similar simulation which is used as initialization for the current run. Works only with constant time step.
INTG,,INITIALIZE_FROM,"0 Index to the place in the files used in the initialization. If 0, last value is used. "
REAL,,VP_MULTI,1.0 Factor for pure liquid saturation vapour pressures. Used for sensitivity test.
INTG,,LIMIT_VAPOURS,"0 if >0, only the first n compounds in the VAP_NAMES are taken to condense on particles "
REAL,h,END_DMPS_PARTIAL,"0 If >0, will terminate USE_DMPS_PARTIAL after this time (in simulation hours)."
LGCL,,NO2_IS_NOX,"T/F If T, NO2 input is considered as NOX. NO2 concentration will be calculated inside the model by subtracting NO from NOX."
LGCL,,NO_NEGATIVE_CONCENTRATIONS,"T/F If T, all concentrations and environmental variables will be max(0,<input>) (T after it has been converted from øC to K)"
REAL,h,FLOAT_CHEMISTRY_AFTER_HRS,Stops updating gas phase concentrations with input values after this time. Affects both concentrations and emissions
REAL,h,FLOAT_CONC_AFTER_HRS,"Same as previous, but only for concentrations"
REAL,h,FLOAT_EMIS_AFTER_HRS,"Same as previous, but only for emissions"
LGCL,,USE_RH_CORRECTION,T/F Use RH correction for H2SO4 condensation
REAL,s,DT_UPPER_LIMIT,"150.0,150.0,150.0 Three-element vector for the upper limits for the time steps CCH, COA and DEP, used with time step optimization."
LGCL,,ENABLE_END_FROM_OUTSIDE,"T/F This option enables graceful termination of the simulation during the simulation. It is done by creating a file called ENDNOW.INIT in the output folder. The file must contain only one word STOP. If T, the existence of this file file is checked each time the model is in PRINT_INTERVAL. If found, the output files are finalized and the simulation stops. The procedure is a one-button operation in the GUI."
REAL,molec/cmü,MIN_CONCTOT_CC_FOR_DVAP,"1000 If time step optimization is used, the changes to control the time steps are not calculated for gases whose concentration is below this limit."
REAL,,ALPHA_COA,1.0 sticking coefficient for coagulation
LGCL,,KELVIN_TAYLOR,T/F approximate Kelvin equation with first 2 terms of the Taylor series. Only used for comparison with some older models.
REAL,"N/mý, J/mü",SURFACE_TENSION,0.05 Common surface tension for liquid phase organic compounds
CHRC,,HARD_CORE,"'GENERIC' Name of the non-evaporating generic composition, used for initialized particles and those from nucleation. Can be thought as primary particles. Must be the last item in the VAP_NAMES file."
REAL,kg/mü,ORGANIC_DENSITY,1400 Common liquid phase density for organic compounds
REAL,kg/mü,HARD_CORE_DENSITY,1400 Density of the GENERIC
REAL,,NPF_DIST,1.15 multiplied with MIN_PARTICLE_DIAM to get the upper diameter where the nucleated particles are distributed. Majority of the clusters will be assigned in MIN_PARTICLE_DIAM.
