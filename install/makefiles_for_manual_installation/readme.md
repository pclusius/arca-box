FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS ONLY IF YOU DON'T USE THE setup.py!

In case you don't want to use the Python "installer", you need
to manually copy a makefile to the ARCA root directory. 

1) copy the relevant "makefile_for_xxx" to ARCA root dir
2) rename "makefile_for_xxx" as "makefile"
3) type command "make"
4) cross fingers
