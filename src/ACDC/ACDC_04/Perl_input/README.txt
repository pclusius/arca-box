#### Thermodynamic data ####

The example input data in this folder has been calculated with the previously used B3LYP//RICC2 method, as decribed in the paper
Olenius et al.: Free energy barrier in the growth of sulfuric acid–ammonia and sulfuric acid–dimethylamine clusters, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 084312 (2013), https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4819024

Newer quantum chemical data sets are recommended for improved quantitative assessments of cluster formation for different chemistries.


#### Cluster sets ####

Please note that the example input files in this folder are compatible with the example files for cluster thermodynamics in this repository.

The cluster set files need to be revised when using other thermochemistry input.
