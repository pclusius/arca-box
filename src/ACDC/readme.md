# Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code

Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code, also known as ACDC, is a tool for studying the very first steps of atmospheric new particle formation from gas-phase molecules. ACDC simulates the dynamics of molecular cluster and small nanoparticle populations by generating and solving the cluster birth-death equations for given ambient conditions, yielding the time evolution of cluster concentrations and formation rates.

ACDC can be applied to

* Simulate cluster formation from different chemical compounds using quantum chemical input data
* Study the details of cluster growth processes by, for example, tracking the growth pathways in simulations
* Evaluate experimental methods to interpret measured molecular cluster data by generating synthetic test data
* Include the initial particle formation dynamics in an aerosol dynamics model by direct coupling
* Generate nanoparticle formation rate data to be used in larger-scale models

This repository contains the cluster equation generator (acdc_YYYY_MM_DD.pl), which is the core of ACDC, as well as ready-made templates for easy conducting of standard simulations (ACDC_Matlab_standard and ACDC_Fortran_standard). Detailed information on all available features can be found in the technical manual, and the quick guide provides the essentials to consider when applying the model on a given set of molecular clusters.

Please note that ACDC is a kinetic model, and does not contain assumptions on the thermodynamic properties of the simulated clusters. Instead, the thermodynamic data is given as input to ACDC. Recent data for clusters of different chemical compositions can be found, for example, in the [Atmospheric Cluster Database (ACDB)](https://github.com/elmjonas/ACDB).
