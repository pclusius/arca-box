This version of ACDC is tuned so that it creates Fortran files for ARCAs parallel-ACDC. 
The functions and function calls are renamed with "D" suffix so that they won't mix with NH3
engine. 

Note that this program creates the "system" and "equation" -files only, to properly be functional, 
makefile has to be properly written to point to driver files and common solvers (by default this is done in ARCA already).
